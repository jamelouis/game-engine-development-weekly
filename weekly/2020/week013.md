* [10 Learnings from 10 Years × Supercell](https://supercell.com/en/news/10-learnings-10-years/7436/)
  
    Always play the infinite game (no pun intended:)). Great teams make great games. Great individuals do not necessarily make a great team; Hire slowly and always raise the bar;Stay as small as possible. Culture is the sum of everyone’s actions, not a slide deck or something written on a wall. Replace control with trust. Don’t let fear of failure guide what you do. Be hold and try new things! Resist the temptation to create processes and rules…even when you have made a mistake! Traditional goal setting does not work in our culture of independent cells. Write down your values and define your culture (and revise as you learn and evolve as a company).
